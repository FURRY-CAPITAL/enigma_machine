### Candlestick Plot
[Code for creating the BoxElem's](https://github.com/SwayStar123/chart_bot/blob/master/src/chartbot.rs)
Keep the BoxElem's in a VecDeque instead, so you can remove the older values, like a rolling window

### Watchtower
Follow the AlphaTerm Watchlist widget. Background color green/red based on return, with ticker name and price. Like the widget on the left in the picture below.

### Microstructure Browser
Leave this to the last. A major problem is performance, which is why we need to implement striding. As mentioned by BahamasTrading [here](https://twitter.com/BahamasTrading/status/1377351224748605442), we need to upsample/downsample based on how zoomed in you are. egui hasn't implemented this yet, implot has though, so we need to implement it in rust.
